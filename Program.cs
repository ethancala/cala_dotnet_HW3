/*The program will enable the user to purchase items from your store. Your store's inventory and corresponding prices will come from a text file. The user will specify the
name of the text file at the beginning of the program. The program will read the inventory and then present the user a
list of what they can buy. To purchase something, the user will type the name of the item and then specify how many
they would like. The program will add the item and quantity to its running tab. At the end, the program will show the
user what they purchased and the final price.*/
